# Whole-Exome-Sequencing-Pipeline-SRR8879057
In this pipeline, I created a whole exome sequencing pipeline for a familial case of congenital heart defect (SRA ID: SRR8879057), measured via validated variant calls by aligning reads with BWA, calling variants using GATK, and annotating them with VEP to give 45717 variants
